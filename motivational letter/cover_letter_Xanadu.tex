	I am so excited to apply for the PsiQuantum Quantum Applications internship position! I am finishing my master's degree in mathematics; I am researching fusion-based quantum computational models and have good quantum industry experience. This opportunity is perfect for me, as I will be able to apply all the experience I've gained and expand my career with new and important knowledge about the field.
	
	Why do I want to work at PsiQuantum?
	
	It has been my dream since I found out how millions of entangled modes can be created using time-domain multiplexing. Since then, I began to relate to the idea of MBQC more and more. During my undergraduate thesis, I researched quantum entangling transformations with the KLM protocol and learned how hard it can be to reliably produce resource states. During my master's degree, I had a project "Strawberry Fields Composer" with which I learned a lot about the structure of light and non-linear elements in photonic circuits. My master's thesis is focused on describing a mathematically full and correct model of FBQC systems. I am diving deep into understanding how QEC codes can be constructed and how to estimate the impact of errors on those codes.
	
	Why would I be a good fit for PsiQuantum Intern?

	I would fit for the "Applications Software" team perfectly, as it has been the focus of my work for the past year. I am working in a growing startup QC Design and managing up to 4 people's work. During my time at QC Design I had a unique opportunity to work on improving the speed of our software. I achieved great results in the simulation part as well as in the decoding process, which played an important role in attracting some of our valuable customers. I am very proud of my work and hope to accomplish even more in my career. That is why I feel like I am ready for a new challenge. I believe in PsiQuantum's mission and can see myself having a long-term career with you.
	
%	Full state simulators take too long to execute and \href{https://www.scottaaronson.com/chp/CHP}{\textcolor{blue}{CHP simulator}} cannot account for arbitrary noise. Not only did I achieve a 10000x speedup, but also I have brought the ability to simulate error models like qubits being  \href{https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-022-05434-1/MediaObjects/41586_2022_5434_MOESM1_ESM.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{leaked}} from the computational system, \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09333}{\textcolor{blue}{Bosonic system}}'s noise and \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04478Clifford}{\textcolor{blue}{Spanning technique}} that allows for the simulation of any coherent noise. We support belief-propagation decoders as well as matching decoders, which were challenging to implement efficiently. 
	
	Thank you for your time and consideration, I hope to hear from you soon!
