	\cventry{}{}{Quantum Software Engineer}{February 2024 - current\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		% Detailed achievements:%
		%\begin{itemize}
		I am working in a growing startup QC Design for over a year and managing up to 4 people's work integration into the software. I implemented a modest algorithm for dealing with qubit's possibility of being  \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05434-1}{\textcolor{blue}{leaked}} from the computational system. I brought a new infrastructure that allowed implementing algorithms in c++ and calling them from Python using CPython. I achieved more than a 10000x speedup for simulations of challenging noise models in the circuit. I added support for \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09333}{\textcolor{blue}{Bosonic system}}'s noise and \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04478Clifford}{\textcolor{blue}{Spanning technique}} that allows for the simulation to converge not to an approximation but to a precise value of the Logical Error Rate for any coherent noise. I also worked on the belief-propagation decoders as well as matching decoders, which were challenging to implement efficiently.

	\cventry{}{}{Huawei Assistant Engineer, Developer}{October 2021 - January 2022\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		% Detailed achievements:%
		%\begin{itemize}
		Worked on backend C\#/.netASP/EntityFramework/Autofac + frontend 3js/react/VR. Developed a system of package communication with no delay that alternates between http and signalR requests.
		%\end{itemize}
	}
	\cventry{}{}{Yandex Developer Intern}{July - Sept 2021\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		% Detailed achievements:%
		%\begin{itemize}
		Worked in two teams on backend C++/Python/SQL. Developed a support system for training scripts to work with stored variable logs. Wrote tests for components that were used to prepare data for a neural network that makes recommendations.

	\section{Projects}
	
	\cventry{}{}{Simulation of photonic quantum computing}{2023\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		Developed a web service dedicated to simulation of linear and non-linear optics for quantum computational models using Python and Django. Used \href{https://strawberryfields.ai/}{\textcolor{blue}{Strawberry fields}} as an underlying engine. (\href{https://github.com/StudioShader/SF_Composer}{\textcolor{blue}{github}})
	}
	\cventry{}{}{Master's Thesis}{2023-2025\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		Investigated a photonic-based model (Fusion-Based Quantum Computing) to implement a topological quantum memory. Explored error models and performed threshold estimations using matching-based decoders on FBQC codes. Demonstrated how logical qubits can be reliably stored by repeatedly fusing resource states, enabling a scalable approach to fault-tolerant quantum memory.
	}
	\cventry{}{}{Undergraduate Thesis}{2022-2023\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		I did research on optimal schemes of entangling transformations in linear quantum optics using a genetic algorithm with GPUs on Pytorch. New schemes were obtained for finding the maximum entangled state, as well as for implementing gates equivalent to CX in the KLM protocol.

	}
	
	\cventry{}{}{Study of the Effect of Noise on Efficient Quantum Search Algorithms}{2022\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		Implemented \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03165-2}{\textcolor{blue}{improved Grover's search algorithm}} with Qiskit and tested it's performance with different noise models. \href{https://github.com/StudioShader/QPSA/blob/main/presentation.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{Presentation}}.
	}
	\cventry{}{}{Quantum Algorithms for VRP and VRPTW Problems}{2021\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		Worked on the problem of finding routes for drilling machines for oil production in collaboration with GazpromNeft. Found a reduction of this problem to QUBO. Used Qiskit to solve it using VQE and QAOA.
	}
	\cventry{}{}{Teacher Assistant}{2023\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		Created homework and course notes on the course "Introduction to Quantum Computation", for prof. \href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnZl40AAAAAJ&hl=en}{\textcolor{blue}{Sergey Tikhomirov}}.
	}
	\cventry{}{}{Quantum Computing and Quantum Information via NMR}{2022\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		I operated an NMR device encoding and entangling two qubits at the School of Experimental Physics of CBPF earning a  \href{https://github.com/StudioShader/StudioShader/blob/main/Certificados-21.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{certificate}}.
	}
	\cventry{}{}{Qiskit Global Summer School 2022 - Quantum Excellence}{2022\vspace{-1.0em}}{}{
		I excelled at Qiskit Global Summer School 2022 which was dedicated to quantum simulations, earning a \href{https://www.credly.com/badges/3304071b-2191-46fe-9de6-0b1cc019a06f/public_url}{\textcolor{blue}{badge on Credly}}.
